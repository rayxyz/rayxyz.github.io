Why I live alone? Good question.

Some people will be terrified if let them live in a lonely house or apartment, but I just enjoy it. People will say why are you enjoying it if there were no companions around, you should be bored to death, we cannot imagine how things will happen if we live in that kind of place, that is insane and we will never live alone in our entire life. But, we will live alone at the end of life, donâ€™t we?

We know if people live together, there will be communications between them. If communications were going wrong,  the trust, interests, and value will be crashed. People have to regain them in a hard and time-consuming way. Someone would say, this is social life, you should deal with people of all walks of life. But I do not think so. Life is so short, why should we spend our invaluable time on these everyday and trivial things which we are not interested. I finally figured out why I and should live alone.

Here is why how do I live alone. The most important factor to me is there is nobody annoys me and I can think deeper and clearer. Imagine there you are writing an article or paper or coding something which needs your full concentration, and you are happily doing it, suddenly there is your roommate who pulls his guitar out of the box and playing it awfully with the sound goes to your ear harshly. What would you think about that? You can never write anything at all. The pleasure of writing your code or article has gone into thin air, you just want to slam the door and get out of the place of hell. Now, we replace the roommate with a cozy sofa or a lovely pet or a lush plant we love, things will be totally different. When we are tired of doing something, we can take a little break to sit on the sofa or enjoying the lovely fresh air the plant gives us. We think deeper and deeper, and finally, work out some difficult problem, this is quite rewarding.

Another reason why I live alone is I can do anything I want. You may have so much unpleasant experience in your life to live with other people whom you do not like. Your roommates might ask you do not do some sort of things, the problem is you cannot control yourself or even feel it when you were actually doing it, like snoring when you sleep. Sometimes you feel guilty and have huge stress because of it. The best way to solve the problem is to move out and find a place yourself and live alone. Then the world gets back to you, you are the king of your place, as they say, my house is my castle.

In addition to doing things you want and, of course, you can benefit more from living alone as a learner. I have enough experience about this. When your roommates and you live in the same room, except unpleasant things may happen, you cannot absorb knowledge efficiently. Have a picture in your mind, you love to learn program as a hobby, but you are always distracted by your roommate by playing songs you really hate. And he may say do not learn that, coding is not suitable for people like us and it is not that useful to code unless you want to do it as a career. As a result, you may lose your hobby in nowhere. Furthermore, there are many types of scientific research have shown that we can learn faster and better in a quiet and comfortable place with less hard-working. For example, when I was alone, I can read a five-hundred-page book faster and easier and grasp the main idea with less effort.

As a coder and learner myself, I know there are more benefits of living alone. And I learned from the news that some people have ruined their career or life of living with people they hate. I am not trying to convince people to live alone no matter what; as a matter of fact, as individuals, people should make their decision if they feel more comfortable being alone, and should respect each other, there is no shame of being alone. Sometimes, we just cannot afford our rent by ourselves, but you can move to a cheaper place even if the environment is not as good as the place where you share with other people.

Except for all the benefits above, living alone also makes you stronger. You got to do all the things by yourself. You have to find an apartment at first, and then you have to sign the contract with your owner or the middle man and pay the bills, the list goes on and on. All of these kinds of stuff make you more adaptable to unknown things you meet in the path of growing, this is what makes you stronger in social life and, at last, you do not need to depend on anyone.

However, there is also scientific studies showing living alone may affect your social skills and psychological behaviors. For example, being alone for a long time may weak the social abilities and do awkward things you do not intend to. This sounds scary, yes, it does. So, what should we do to avoid these side effects? I suggest taking a walk every day with your colleagues after lunch in working days and chat online with your friends when you are free is a good strategy to alleviate those bad effects of being alone.

All in all, there are pros and cons to living alone. As human beings and social animals, we have emotional feelings since emerging millions of years ago, we cannot live the whole life by ourselves in an isolated situation. But if you are looking to a better future you should make the right choice. Live alone temporarily may help you to gain knowledge and do deep thinking in a better way, this will make you different. Many people have their dreams not approached because they do not dare to make a challenging plan and execute it immediately. They have concerned about age, parents, risks, and so many other things, they just cheat on themselves with all kinds of excuses; they will never see the blue sky above the smoggy town. Although, being different means we must lose something, something we favorite, something we love, and even something we admire. Maybe we become somebody we even do not like to be for a period of time, but only in this way can we have affluent life experience we are looking for.

Enjoy your day!
