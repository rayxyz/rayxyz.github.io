# Yoube is big, and I got educated
There are so many types of quality videos on different channels on Youtube. I can find open courses, television programs and all sorts of videos uploaded by people all around the globe, and I can watch live stream.

In our lives, we have so many unknown fields we didn't reach before, but the most talented people in those fields made videos and uploaded on Youtube, we can educate ourselves by watching the videos. If I want to find knowledge about quantum physics, I used to google it, but now I will do Youtbe it first. The videos tell you more detail and vividly describe the concepts, it's time saving and easier to understand.

# Youtube is big, and I am fucked
I googled it, there are more than 5 billion videos on Youtube by now, and the number is growing faster everyday. 5 billion? unbelievable. It is not just the number of videos, but most of them are high definition, 720P to 4K. It's insane, people can upload 4K videos, and it can stream online. I mean, the devices of 4K resolution are not common in everyday life by now.

Because of the number of videos and quality, wander all the corners of Youtube has become my habit. I can easily drawn in the river of digital ocean. I can watch the videos all day without moving my legs. Sometimes I don't know what am I watching for, the mind seems goes into a lazy zone, the attempt of watching videos takes over by body. After watching lots of videos, I got tired, I blame myself why did I waste so much time to watch those junks.

I know sit all day before the computer screen is not good for health.

# How to defeat the addiction
The Youtube addiction is strong in my bottom of heart. I know maybe I will never get rid of it. But I am trying to defeat it. Below are some strategies I use to not let the evil spirit of addiction take over me.

## Strategy one: Blogging
I found blogging is a good way to avoid watching videos. To write a post, I need to concentrate intensely on the topic I am writing on, the deep thinking takes over almost the room of my mind, so I don't have much other attention to think other things. When I was blogging, I get into a spiritual world, there I feel the power of deep thinking, it frees me in the real word and lets into the paradise of freedom. The spirits run and fly within my head, I can feel I am myself, this feeling is maybe the result of the source of real self.

Blogging has another advantage over watching junk videos-blogging makes me think more clearly and positively. Write a post is not an easy thing, I need clean up my mind, try to use the proper word to explain what am I going to say. Sometimes, it takes much time to write down a paragraph, and sometimes I don't need to think harshly, the ideas just jump out of my head, I could see a picture in front of me, the things in that picture are alive and I can get into the picture, to join the people and communicate. The brain activities through all the thinking let me get into the pure soul of myself. I know who am I want to be. The writing process strengthens my mind to overcome the bad habits easily, because I know the power of blogging is much more powerful than any other evil spirits.

## Strategy two: Do some reading

## Strategy three: Get out and exercise
