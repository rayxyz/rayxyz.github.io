I had an odyssey dream this morning. Sharing it with people is an effective way to make it up to another level, whether by memory or by emotion. I had the habit of recording my dreams. Turning virtual world experience into real-world memory is an interesting chore. Let's transform it.

At the beginning I was in India, I don't remember how did I get there. I was in a scene: there was the laundry place, which got famous as the world's largest open laundry factory. The weather was not hot or humidity, like in subtropical Indian peninsula, more like in Fall in Kunming, dry and chill, weird. I wore an eye-catching long black jacket. When I realized my jacket got cut because of one of the old women tried to steal something, I yelled out "fuck it" with rage. Another weird thing: I noticed the old women's appearance were like the ones in my hometown back in Dali. I must put my real world brain data into the virtual one. The surrounding scenery was stunning and unrealistic, snow-capped mountains on my far-side left and ocean on the right side, the wave shining under the sun. Wandering at the surroundings, I got a little bored.

A boy got my attention. He looked like the boys at slums of Indian movies, who wore a fully dust-stained yellow T-shirt. He was a little confusing, wanted to get near me, from his eyes I knew he might not be honest. He touched my cloth, I turned my hand back and stared at him, he got away. For no reason, the boy became my guide and my best friend in India. I followed him to explore this unique unknown world. With excited feelings, I didn't know where we would go and what we would do. I call the boy "boy," We communicated in English, he understood me with no issue. We walked along the shore for a long time. We stopped by a stream, he told me the water was drinkable. I picked up an empty Coca-Cola bottle on the road, removed its mouth, filled it with the water. I put the bottle to his mouth, let him drank first because he seemed thirsty. He drank it all. I refilled the bottle, this time for me to drink. When we climbed on an aqueduct tube, I found out the water was streamed from the dirty laundry place, I almost puked. 

I don't remember most parts of my dream in Indian. All I know now is I couldn't found the boy anymore. Because of my lost friend, I walked along the shore with frustrating mood. I unexpectedly entered a somewhat "time-travel gate" and showed up in the U.S.

The U.S was not like it in the movies. Weird enough, the first impression of it was most people there were Asians. I forgot how did I encounter a young Asian man who spoke flawless Mandarin. He dressed in a striped T-shirt, black trousers, some young people in China do the same. He looked like the Indian boy; upsetting, lingering around with no purpose. I followed him wherever he went. I enjoyed being in the U.S, a country that was a myth to me for I saw it only in the movies. 

We queued into a modern tall building. We just stepped in a room, a well dressed middle-aged woman in the front called upon my fellow. The woman mumbled something toward him with condemning facial expressions. The young man didn't care about her. We left the room, the woman's eyes were staring at us with fire, the air seemed melting. Once we ducked out of the building, I figured out we were at a college campus. I could see so many Asian students around us, but a few white students. The college students with backpacks and books in their hands, they were young, healthy, and confident. The young man and I carried on the unknown journey. What followed next is unclear.

The last part of the dream was scary. I was walking on a street of some empty CBD area and was being spied on by some guys, they covered themselves with black coats, and wore masks. They had guns in their hands. They could have shot me down. At that moment, I found I also had one in my jacket's pocket for no reason. I knew the situation would be terrible. I climbed on a building, yeah, I mean real "climb," seemed I had the superpower. Those agent-looking people were chasing after me and shooting their guns. I hid behind the building, aimed at them and shot. 

What followed the shooting scenario is unclear. I was at last in a military truck. It was driving on a bumpy road, nobody knew what's the destination, maybe a camp. I guess I was doing great in the shooting, so the army's leader wanted me to join his army, and I was forced to do so.

That is all I dreamed about this morning. As human beings, according to scientific research, can have several dreams every day, but we always easily forget all of them. As soon as I get up, I write this because it is interesting and meaningful to record dreams even by the good old way of writing. 

Dreams are absolutely affected by what we had experienced in real life. Elements from movies or YouTube videos and people we know can be easily spotted. The magical part is our brain does great work for creating the virtual world, and we cannot tell it is not real. 

Speaking to technology, we are staggering into the future, an age depicted by movies and writings decades ago, if not hundreds of years ago. If we human beings invent a technology, by which we can open the door of lucid dreaming but not the uncomfortable virtual worlds created by status quo VR technology. 

Dream sharing may become true in the future, corresponding to today's TV series and movies. Even one day, we may be able to share our dreams online, looking at other people's blogs writings and homemade vlogs today. It is good or not, nobody knows.
